# Website code Refactoring project 1
For this week project, I made changes to an existing html webpage by making the code nicer to read
I do this by by increasing the accessibility standard of the code
## Steps
* First, I changed the non-semantic elements from the html code to semantic elements
* Second, I made sure that the elements follow a logical structure
* Thirdly, I gave alt attributes to images so that website and other developer can easily distinguish
* Lastly, I gave the website a descriptive title that describe the purpose of the code
## Additional Requirements
* CSS style sheet and html are properly commented
* Includes a readme page
